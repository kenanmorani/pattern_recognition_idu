# Introduction
The codes are aolutions to assignments for a course at Izmir Democracy University.
# The Codes
### PCA&LDA_on_IRIS_dataset.ipynb:                                                                                
* The code builds two classes; Principle Component Analysis class and Linear Disciminant Analysis class as two demintionality reduction methods. 
* The methods are applied on the popular IRIS dataset.
### Clustering Toy Data
* The code includes three different clustering algorithms; k-means, single linkage, and complete linkage.
* The algorithms are tried for different cluster numbers (k). 
* The algorithms are tried for 2-dimensional data in the clustering_toy_data.csv.
* The verifying dataset 'clustering_toy_data.csv' is in the 'data' folder.
* The code includes comments on the results.
